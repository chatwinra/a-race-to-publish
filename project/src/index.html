		<p> This is an extract from a new card game called 'Science:A Race To Publish'. The game is targeted at 11-18 year olds and aims to introduce some core scientific and general management concepts including famous scientists and theories, science communication theory, career paths in science and money/laboratory management.</p>
		
		<p>Before you ask, two things we should say about this mini-game. Firstly, the letters next to a scientist's name represents their primary discipline-Biology, Physics, Maths or Chemistry. Secondly, the scores associated with each scientist should be taken in the context which they're given- a game! Obviously every scientist presented here has had a huge impact on their respective fields, but giving them all an impact score of 10 wouldn't make for a very fun game!</p>
